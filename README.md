# Tarkov-Scammer
Scams tarkov market plebs using the [Tarkov Market](https://tarkov-market.com/) API.

Puts out a list of the things that you can buy on the market
for less than you can sell it to the in game vendors for. 

Note that this is _NOT_ an automated money making bot. If you try to use it to
automate buying and selling, don't blame me if Tarkov bans you :)

## Running
First, get an API key from Tarkov-Market (note, a paid Tarkov-Market account
is required). Then, pass that as the only argument to the function `scam.py`.

For example, `pyhton3 scam.py YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`.
